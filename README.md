My attempt at Advent of Code 2020

# Notes
- day 4 part 2 could have been solved using regex which would've saved a lot more time. i wasn't confident with my regex knowledge so i decided not to do it.
- day 7 was a dp problem that could be solved via memoization 
- day 9 part 2 was especially difficult. i surmise there's a more efficient solution using dynamic programming, but i solved it using brute force instead. need to redo that solution in the future.
- day 10 part 2 takes especially long with just recursive dfs. There's probably some way to speed it up with dp but I'm not sure how yet.
