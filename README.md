My attempt at Advent of Code 2020

#Notes
- day 4 part 2 could have been solved using regex which would've saved a lot more time. i wasn't confident with my regex knowledge so i decided not to do it.
- day 9 part 2 was especially difficult. i surmise there's a more efficient solution using dynamic programming, but i solved it using brute force instead. need to redo that solution in the future.
